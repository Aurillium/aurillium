# Hello!

I'm Memphis Marshall, a student studying computer science at Edith Cowan University. I also like security and enjoy CTFs and pentesting, plus researching and experimenting with new exploits. I also write a lot of open-source code because I rely a lot on other projects and want to allow others to do the same. I believe it's an important for programming to be accessible to all. My main languages are Rust, Python, JavaScript (node.js), and C++, but I like to experiment and occasionally use a lot more.

# Projects
## LunaJuice
LunaJuice is an experimental tool to monitor and log the activities of suspicious Windows processes. It can be injected by normal users or administrators (to work on any non-protected process) and hosts a local RPC server to query and change configuration. Its goal is to be easily integrated into defensive workflows and be highly customisable to the user's needs.

## Invisirun
An alternative commandline spoofing proof-of-concept. Invisirun uses NtCreateUserProcess to pad the `Commandline` property of the PEB with null characters, aiming to avoid detection by trailing spaces/other characters.

## Pronoun Bot
PronounBot is a Discord bot designed to help gender-questioning people try out new names and prnouns, complete with lots of flexible options and a community Discord server to allow non-programmers to contribute to the project in their own way.

### Mindbreaker
An optimising compiler for a questionably named 8-character programming language. While it's not very useful practically it was a good learning excerise about low level languages. Compatible with linking programs.

### SlashCommandBase
A modular Discord bot system for Discord.js. Every file contains code to handle one kind of interaction, which are organised into folders. An earlier version of this is what I used to make PronounBot.
