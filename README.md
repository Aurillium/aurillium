# Hello!

I'm Memphis Marshall, a student studying computer science at Edith Cowan University. I write a lot of open-source code because I rely a lot on other open source code and believe it's an important and useful community and I want programming to be accessible to all. My main languages are JavaScript (node.js), Java, Python, and Go, but I experiment and occasionally use a lot more.

## Projects
### Pronoun Bot
As someone who is part of the lgbtq+ community, it is important to me and I like to give back to it. PronounBot is a Discord bot designed to help gender-questioning people try out new names and prnouns, complete with lots of flexible options and a community Discord server to allow non-programmers to contribute to the project in their own way.

### Mindbreaker
An optimising compiler for a questionably named 8-character programming language. While it's not very useful practically it was a good learning excerise about low level languages. Compatible with linking programs.

### SlashCommandBase
A modular Discord bot system for Discord.js. Every file contains code to handle one kind of interaction, which are organised into folders. An earlier version of this is what I used to make PronounBot.
